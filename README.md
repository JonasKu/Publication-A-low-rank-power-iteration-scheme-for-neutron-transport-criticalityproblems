# Publication-A-low-rank-power-iteration-scheme-for-neutron-transport-criticalityproblems

This is the code framework that was used in the paper "A low-rank power iteration scheme for neutron transport criticality problems". The individual testcases with Material {material} can be run with the command "python driver{material}.py". The corresponding images are plotted with the scripts "plotBasis" and "plotKEffHistory". Note that the cross section data cannot be included.
